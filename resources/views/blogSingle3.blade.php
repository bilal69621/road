                        <h3>How to Maintain Your Car to Minimize Issues</h3>
                        <p>Taking good care of your car is as important as the periodical maintenance that we all do a couple of times per year. This will minimize the risk to need emergency roadside assistance or to incur in expensive repairs.</p>
                        <p>Here are a few tips that anybody could follow to always keep a car in great conditions.</p>
                        <h4>Check Your Tires</h4>

                        <p>As we mentioned in a previous article (link here to the article about tires), checking your tires is very easy and takes a minute. However, this could prevent bigger issue from presenting themselves.</p>
                        <p>Make sure you donâ€™t have any cracks on the tires and that they are not worn out to avoid potentially dangerous situations.</p>
                        <h4>Look for Alerts on Your Dashboard</h4>
                        <img src="{{asset('public/assets/images/blog19.png')}}"/>
                        <p>This is something very easy to do since, if something is wrong, red lights will be all over your car dashboard. Usually, most alerts are about fluid that always need to be kept to an optimal level. Engine oil, brake and power steering fluids can cause expensive damages if they are not checked periodically</p>
                        <p>
                            If you are not comfortable with checking them, any mechanic could help you in a matter of minutes.

                        <h4>Replace Your Windshield Wipers</h4>
                        <img src="{{asset('public/assets/images/blog20.png')}}"/>
                        <p>You will realize how important good windshield wipers are during heavy rains and other situations with reduced visibility. You always want your wipers to be working perfectly to avoid getting yourself in dangerous accidents.</p>
                        <p>You can easily order wipers that are compatible with your car online and replace them yourself in a matter of seconds.</p>
                        <h4>Check Your Brakes</h4>
                        <img src="{{asset('public/assets/images/blog21.png')}}"/>
                        <p>Always keep an ear out for noises with your brakes. They are a clear indicator that something might be wrong with them. Needless to say, you want to avoid having your brakes give up on you considering that they are the only way to stop your car. </p>
                        <p>Check them regularly with professional help and replace the brake pads when necessary.</p>
                        <h4>Check Your Lights</h4>
                        <img src="{{asset('public/assets/images/blog22.png')}}"/>
                        <p>Making sure that all of your lights work is not recommended only to avoid a fine. Lights keep you safe and make sure that other drivers can see you. We recommend checking your lights on a weekly basis and replacing any broken one right away.</p>
                        <p>This will take a minute and it could possibly keep you safe from very dangerous scenario.</p>
